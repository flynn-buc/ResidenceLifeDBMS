# Residential Housing JDBC management app

## About the project
This project aims to deliver a management system for university housing. 

Users, usually a building manager, can access all information about the location of residences across various campuses of the same university, each residence's housing capacity, broken down per floor, units, and vacancies. Managers also have access to information pertinent to the students living in each unit, including but not limited to their name, student ID, and their email. 

Managers can also view which Senior Advisors and Residential Advisors are assigned to each house or floor. 

Information can be updated as needed to reflect the most up to date housing status. 

All information can be accessed conveniently through the Java FX UI, and information about any particular entity (house, floor, resident etc..) can be easily searched and filtered in real time.
